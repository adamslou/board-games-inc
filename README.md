This is a database-driven inventory management web app written in Python/Flask. This app is designed to be a cashier UI that will provide users with inventory and pricing information as well as provide an interface for keeping track of orders made in the store.  Users will be managers and employees of Board Games Inc.  Prices of items will be able to be updated as well as the quantity available in inventory. The application will keep track of all orders made including billing information for each order, quantity of items in each order, and the employee responsible for taking the order.  The backend database will record customers, items (which contains information about the quantity of items available and their price), order_items (which contains information concerning the quantity of each item in an order), orders (which contains sales and billing information), and employees (which allows orders to track which employee took a particular order) .  Information about total sales for the store is tracked through the orders that are made.  Crucial information concerning price and quantity of items available in inventory can be updated through the items table.
